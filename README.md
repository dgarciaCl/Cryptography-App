# Cryptography App

A simple Python library reservations app using various cryptographic functions to apply the topics covered in class

This application allows students to register, authenticate, book rooms and verify reservations while guaranteeing the confidentiality and the data integrity of all stored information.

## Main cryptographic features

- Password storage with `Scrypt`
- Data encryption with `ChaCha20Poly1305`
- `RSA` for digital signature
- `x509` public key certificates
- Serialisation using `pkcs8`
- `SHA256` for certificate verification
